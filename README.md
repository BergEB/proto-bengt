# ~==~ SELDOM ~==~


*SELDOM is a compilation of the most appealing Processing sketches I have created this year, each of which is displayed sequentially within a (generally) static enviormment. These concepts are each displayed within seperate rooms, allowing for the viewer to experience each concept in it's entirety.

### Difficulties or opportunities you encountered along the way.

The toughest part was...
